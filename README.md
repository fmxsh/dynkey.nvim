# Dynamic keys

> [!NOTE]
> Not adapted for public usability. Integrated into my personal setup.

Provides functionality for dynamic keys. It assigns a character to an entity and remembers that. Say the name of a buffer `/etc/hosts` is given the key `h`.

It supports contexts, meaning a set of keys are bound to a set of enteties within a context. The same characters can be bound to other enteties in another context.

Very generic functionality that is integrated into my project manager which assigns characters to buffers, projects, etc. The project manager, using other code, usually makes keybindings for different operations on the enteties, such as switching to a project by pressing the related keybind.

## Todo

- Unsure about the color code. I have color code everywhere. Need make a single module for all color things.
